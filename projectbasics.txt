Project Requirements

Controller
	Android or iOS device
	UI using touch screen

	Functionality:
		Search for media on server
		Play
		Pause
		Stop
		FF
		Rewind

Renderer
	PC, Mac, or Laptop
	Receives request from Controller
	Opens local program necessary to play media on this device, cannot use any pre-integrated network functionality (like VLC has)
	Requests content from server to play

Server
	Manage and provide media to the Renderer
	Must be able to return search functionality to Controller

These are just the base requirements from the document.  Anything above and beyond has, in the past, been used as extra credit.

Basic Steps and Milestones

	Creating sockets to successfully send/receive information between iOS/Android device, Renderer, and Server
	Set up Server to handle search functionality and media storage
		Easy to set up a MySQL server with media and location info, serve it out to other devices
	Enable Renderer to start up programs on machine it resides on
	Enable Renderer to control other programs on the machine it resides on (stop, start, open, play, etc).
	Set up GUI on iOS/Android for easy navigation and search (virtual iPod style controls?)
